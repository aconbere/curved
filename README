## How to use Curved

The first step to using curved is to generate a calibrated step wedge. Each step wedge is a 16bit greyscal image consisting of 101 steps from pure white to pure black. Running the following command will create such an step wedge in the file "test.png".

> curved generate --output test.png

Once you have a step wedge you need to print it onto transparency and then print it with the process your printing. Once you have your output print you should scan it. The higher quality the scan the better the software is at analysis, prefer a 16bit greyscale tif to anything else.

With your scan in hand you can then analyze it. This will generate a file `curve.json` in the provided output directory. This encodes the correction curve that you'll want to apply to any subsequent images to correct for any issues.

> curved analyze --input scan.tif --output-dir ./output

Lastly now that you have a correction curve you can apply it to an image to print.

> curved apply --input ./test.png --curve ./output/curve.json --output-dir ./output

This will take the file in test.png and apply the curve.json correction curve, outputing the now corrected image to `./output/curved-test.png`

## Explanation

The goal is to understand how we need to modulate the digital tone so that our final print matches the digital rendering as closely as possible.

To do this we generate a step wedge with a linear contrast scale; 101 from black to white in equal increments. Print that wedge onto transparency to create what's called a "digital negative", and then print the digital negative in the process we're studying (new cyanotype for example) to create an analog print.

The result of this  process will be a print of 101 squares that do NOT go from black to white in equal increments. (in the case of the example I showed the black and white points were off). 

Scanning the print we can then do a digital analysis of that image to understand example how NOT equal those increments are. The result of that analysis is a mapping from the input tonal value from the first step wedge, the value that would create the desired output tone in the second wedge. This function is called a "tone curve".

As a final step we then generate a new step wedge, but this time with the tone curve applied. The new step wedge will look all wrong on our monitor, but when we make the analog print from it, it should (in theory), posses a close to linear tone curve that we expected.
